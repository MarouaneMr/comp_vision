# Navigation System
This project utilizes computer vision techniques to enable map navigation through hand gestures. The system captures hand movements through a webcam and translates them into actions such as cursor movement, zooming, and dragging on a map interface.

## Requirements:
- OpenCV (4.9.0.80)
- Mediapipe (0.9.1.0)
- PyAutoGUI
- Pyhton 3.x

## Usage
1. Clone repository in your local machine
2. Intall all requirements ( pip install -r requirements.txt)
3. Run map.py
4. Ensure you give permissions to VSCode for webcam usage
5. Open any map navigator (preferably Google Earth)
6. Navigate to your favorite places!

## Hand Gestures Menu:
### Cursor movement
### Zooming
### Dragging

## Note:
- Ensure you are in a setting with proper lighting conditions for more accuracy in the hand detection
